# Typing Speed Test in Python ⌨️⚡

The Typing Speed Test is a Python project that allows users to measure how fast and accurately they can type.  
The program displays a random sentence, records the time taken by the user to type it, calculates typing speed, and counts typing mistakes.

This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and a great way to practice Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, time handling, and randomization.

## 🧭 Project Overview

Typing speed is measured based on:
- time taken
- length of typed text
- number of mistakes

The program helps users:
- improve typing speed
- reduce typing errors
- practice accuracy and consistency

---

## ✨ Features

- ✔ Random sentences for typing practice  
- ✔ Measures typing speed  
- ✔ Counts mistakes in typed text  
- ✔ Displays total time taken  
- ✔ Beginner-friendly Python implementation  
- ✔ Works directly in command prompt / terminal

## 🧪 How the Program Works

1. Program asks user if they are ready
2. A random sentence appears on the screen
3. User types the sentence
4. Program calculates:
   - time taken
   - typing speed
   - mistake count
5. Output is displayed on screen

## 🧮 Typing Speed Formula (Simple)

Typing Speed = **characters typed / time taken**

You can modify it later to:
- WPM (words per minute)
- accuracy percentage

---

## 📊 Sample Output

Example result displayed by program:

- Typing Speed: 52
- Errors: 1
- Time Taken: few seconds

A screenshot is attached as `typing_speed_output.png`.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

You can upgrade this project by adding:

- GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
- WPM calculation
- accuracy percentage
- leaderboard or score saving
- custom paragraph input
- difficulty levels
